The class will contain basic information about a contractor, such as their name, number, and start date. We'll create one or more constructors, as well as accessor (getter) and mutator (setter) functions.

The subcontractor class will inherit from Contractor and add additional information specific to subcontractors, such as their shift and hourly pay rate.

The program class sets up a simple demonstration where you can create Subcontractor objects and compute their pay with a shift differential for night shift employees. This can be easily modified for more advance functions.
